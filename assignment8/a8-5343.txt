Assignment 8


Due: 11:59 AM, Friday, March 22 (on elearning).

This is not a programming assignment.  Write code or pseudocode.

1.
Binary search trees and AVL trees are declared as follows:
class BST<T> {
    class Entry {
	T element;
	Entry left, right;
    }

    Entry root;  // root node of BST
    int size;    // number of elements in tree
}

class AVL<T> extends BST<T> {
    class Entry extends BST.Entry {
	int height;
    }
}

Assume that both classes have been implemented.  Write a method of the
AVL class that verifies if the tree is a valid AVL tree, that satisfies
all conditions of BST, and the balancing conditions of AVL trees.
In addition, do not trust the height value stored at the nodes, and
heights of nodes have to be verified to be correct.  Make your code
as efficient as possible.  State the running time of your algorithm.

	boolean verify() {  /* To do */  }

HINT: Look at the bottom-up solution to verify BST

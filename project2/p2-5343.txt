Project 2: BST and AVL trees

Due: 11:59 PM, Wednesday March 27, 2024 (elearning).

This is as an individual project. Do not share your work with others.
Don not use the code from any outside sources.
ANY SUSPICION OF PLAGIARISM WILL BE REPORTED to OCSC.


Submission procedure:

* Create a folder whose name is your netid (NId).
* Place all files you are submitting in that folder.
* Use "package NId;" in all your java files.
* Include the class files also in your zip file.
* Include a text file named "readme.txt", that explains how to compile and run the code.
* Zip the contents into a single zip or rar file.
* If the zip file is bigger than 1 MB, you have included unnecessary files.
* Delete them and create the zip file again.
* Upload the zip or rar file on elearning.
* Submission can be revised before the deadline.
* The final submission before the deadline will be graded.


There are two parts in this project

1. Implement binary search trees.  Starter code BinarySearchTree.java is in the shared folder.
   The methods you need to implement are: contains(), add(), remove(). Other methods are optional.
   Do not define parent field in Entry class. Implement the single pass algorithm discussed in the class.


2. Extend BST to AVL tree.  Starter code: AVLTree.java is in the shared folder. Driver code is also provided.
   The methods you need to implement are: add(), verify().
   Implement remove() for extra credits (5 points will be added to Theory part).
   Do not rewrite the code for find(), add(), and remove(). Inherit the methods from BinarySearchTree class.

   The number of rotations required during deletion could be O(log n). We may have to do rotation at every level.
   For more details, check this https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~holte/T26/tree-deletion.html

Starter code BinarySearchTree.java, AVLTree.java, AVLTreeDriver.java, Timer.java are in folder P2 which is in the shared box folder. We will upload some testcases to P2 folder soon.

Rubric:
Code review: 40 points
Testcases: 50 points
Style: 10 points
If you do not follow the submission procedure, we will deduct 10 points.

Assignment 1

Due: 11:59 PM, Wed, Jan 24 (on elearning).

1. In binary search, a target element is searched in a sorted array using divide and conquer approach. If the element is found, the search returns true. Otherwise it returns false. In this assignment you will write code for a variant of the binary search. Your code should return index i such that A[i] <= t < A[i+i], where t is the element searched in sorted array A. Note that the elements in the array may contain duplicates.

Input: Sorted Array of integers A[0,â€¦,n-1] and target t 
Output: return index i such that A[i] <= t < A[i+1]
		// If t < arr[0], return -1.  If t >= arr[n-1], return n-1.  n is A.length()
		
public static int bsearchv(int[] A, int t){
	
	// complete the code

}

Assignment 4

Due: Fri, Feb 16:  11:59 PM (on elearning).

1. Complete the methods next() and remove() in SinglyLinkedList.java. File is in the shared folder. To learn more about iterator see the reference below.

Practice problems (no need to submit):

2. Complete method unzip() in SinglyLinkedList.java

3. What is the running time of the following two programs on a linked list with n elements:

   (a) for(x: list) { print x }  /* using the iterator */
	/* same as:  it = list.iterator();  while(it.hasNext()) { print it.next() } */

	Ans: this takes O(n) time

   (b) for(i=0; i<list.size(); i++) { print list.get(i) }

   Ans: this takes O(n^2) time
